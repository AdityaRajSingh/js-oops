// Encapsulation is defined as binding the data and methods into a single unit to protect it from outside access.
// In the context of class, some properties are not directly accessed from outside of the class.
// You need to call the responsible method for the properties.
// It's like creating a getter/setter method for the private properties we declare in a class.
